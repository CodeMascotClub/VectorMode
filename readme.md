## [Localhost](https://github.com/rnaby/VectorMode) | [Server Host](https://github.com/rnaby/VectorMode)

Right now I'll suggest you to host this application on your localhost. In future I'll release a web host version. This application will also run smoothly on server also, but it is not recommended. For any support or assistance please email  me naby88@gmail.com.

It is a point of sale (POS) software. With this piece of software you can manage your product sales data easily. I've written this for one of my friends business.
